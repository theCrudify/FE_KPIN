# Superior Employee Full Names Implementation

## Overview

This implementation enhances the superior employee dropdown functionality to display full names instead of just usernames. The system now combines data from the `employee-superior-document-approvals` API with user details from the `/api/users` endpoint to show complete user names.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `js/addReim.js`

**Updated `fetchSuperiorEmployees` function:**
- Added logic to fetch full user details for each superior employee
- First tries to get full names from cached users (`window.allUsers`)
- Falls back to API call to `/api/users/{userId}` if not in cache
- Returns superiors with `superiorFullName` field containing the full name

**Updated `populateSuperiorEmployeeDropdown` function:**
- Changed dropdown options to use `superiorFullName` instead of `superiorName`
- Updated search input dataset to use full names
- Updated pending approval value setting to use full names

### 2. Modified `js/detailReim.js`

**Updated `fetchSuperiorEmployees` function:**
- Same changes as in `addReim.js`
- Added full name fetching logic with caching support

**Updated `populateSuperiorEmployeeDropdown` function:**
- Changed dropdown options to use `superiorFullName` instead of `superiorName`
- Updated search input dataset to use full names
- Updated pending approval value setting to use full names

## How It Works

### 1. API Integration

The system uses two APIs:
- **Primary API**: `employee-superior-document-approvals/user/{userId}/document-type/{documentType}`
  - Returns superior employees with basic information
  - Contains `userName` and `superiorName` fields

- **User Details API**: `/api/users/{userId}`
  - Provides full user information including `fullName`
  - Used to enhance superior employee data

### 2. Caching Strategy

The implementation uses a two-tier caching approach:
1. **Primary Cache**: `window.allUsers` - stores all users fetched during page load
2. **Fallback**: Direct API call to `/api/users/{userId}` if user not in cache

### 3. Transaction Type Mapping

The system maps transaction types to API codes:
- Entertainment → EN
- Golf Competition → GC
- Medical → ME
- Others → OT
- Travelling → TR

### 4. Superior Level Mapping

Superior levels are mapped to field IDs:
- Prepared By → PR
- Checked By → CH
- Acknowledged By → AC
- Approved By → AP
- Received By → RE

## Usage

### For Reimbursement (RE) Documents

1. **Add Page** (`/addPages/addReim.html`):
   - Select transaction type from dropdown
   - Superior employee dropdowns automatically populate with full names
   - Search functionality works with full names

2. **Detail Page** (`/detailPages/detailReim.html`):
   - Same functionality as add page
   - Full names displayed in all approval fields

### Example API Response

**Original API Response:**
```json
{
  "status": true,
  "code": 200,
  "message": "Operation successful",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 148,
      "userID": "f17f5373-61af-4d48-9686-2d3f64ade525",
      "typeDocument": "RE",
      "typeTransaction": "TR",
      "superiorUserId": "b8f9a821-1867-4249-b635-ad83a6d66cdc",
      "superiorLevel": "CH",
      "createdAt": "2025-07-19T17:08:51",
      "updatedAt": "2025-07-19T17:08:51",
      "userName": "dalari",
      "superiorName": "pasuansusen"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Enhanced Data Structure:**
```json
{
  "id": 148,
  "userID": "f17f5373-61af-4d48-9686-2d3f64ade525",
  "typeDocument": "RE",
  "typeTransaction": "TR",
  "superiorUserId": "b8f9a821-1867-4249-b635-ad83a6d66cdc",
  "superiorLevel": "CH",
  "createdAt": "2025-07-19T17:08:51",
  "updatedAt": "2025-07-19T17:08:51",
  "userName": "dalari",
  "superiorName": "pasuansusen",
  "superiorFullName": "Pasuansusen Full Name"
}
```

## Error Handling

The implementation includes robust error handling:
- Falls back to original `superiorName` if full name fetch fails
- Logs warnings for failed API calls
- Continues processing even if individual user lookups fail
- Maintains backward compatibility

## Testing

A test file `test-superior-employees.html` has been created to verify the functionality:
- Tests different document types (RE, PR)
- Tests all transaction types
- Tests all superior levels
- Shows both original and full names for comparison
- Includes a test dropdown to verify the UI behavior

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Users see full names instead of usernames
2. **Improved Clarity**: Easier to identify the correct person
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Falls back to original names if full names unavailable
4. **Performance**: Uses caching to minimize API calls
5. **Consistency**: Works across both add and detail pages

## Files Modified

1. `js/addReim.js` - Updated superior employee functionality
2. `js/detailReim.js` - Updated superior employee functionality
3. `test-superior-employees.html` - Test file for verification

## Future Enhancements

1. **Extend to Other Document Types**: Apply same logic to Purchase Request (PR) and other document types
2. **Additional User Fields**: Include employee ID, department, or other relevant information
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Add search by employee ID or department
4. **Performance Optimization**: Implement more sophisticated caching strategies
