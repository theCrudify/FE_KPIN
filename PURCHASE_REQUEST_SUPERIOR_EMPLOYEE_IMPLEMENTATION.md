# Purchase Request Superior Employee Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of superior employee functionality with full names for Purchase Request (PR) documents, similar to the Reimbursement implementation. The functionality allows filtering superior employees based on document type, transaction type, and approval field, while displaying full names instead of usernames.

## Files Modified

### 1. addPages/addPR.html
- **Updated**: Approval section to use superior employee dropdowns with search functionality
- **Changed**: Search input placeholders to "Search name..." for consistency
- **Note**: No transaction type dropdown needed - PR documents always use "NRM"

### 2. js/addPR.js
- **Added**: `fetchSuperiorEmployees()` function to fetch and filter superior employees
- **Added**: `getSuperiorLevelForField()` function to map field IDs to superior levels
- **Added**: `populateSuperiorEmployeeDropdown()` function to populate dropdowns with full names
- **Added**: `populateAllSuperiorEmployeeDropdowns()` function to populate all approval fields
- **Added**: `autoFillPreparedBy()` function to auto-fill current user
- **Updated**: `populateUserSelects()` function to work with superior employee functionality
- **Updated**: `filterUsers()` function to work with superior employee data
- **Updated**: `submitDocument()` function to handle preparedBy field properly
- **Added**: Event listener for transaction type dropdown to trigger superior employee population

### 3. detailPages/detailPR.html
- **Updated**: Approval section to use superior employee dropdowns with search functionality
- **Changed**: Search input placeholders to "Search name..." for consistency
- **Note**: No transaction type dropdown needed - PR documents always use "NRM"

### 4. js/detailPR.js
- **Added**: `fetchSuperiorEmployees()` function (same as addPR.js)
- **Added**: `getSuperiorLevelForField()` function (same as addPR.js)
- **Added**: `populateSuperiorEmployeeDropdown()` function (same as addPR.js)
- **Added**: `populateAllSuperiorEmployeeDropdowns()` function (same as addPR.js)
- **Added**: `autoFillPreparedBy()` function to auto-fill current user
- **Updated**: `populateUserSelects()` function to work with superior employee functionality
- **Updated**: `filterUsers()` function to work with superior employee data
- **Updated**: `updatePR()` function to handle preparedBy field properly
- **Added**: Event listener for transaction type dropdown to trigger superior employee population

## API Integration

### Endpoints Used
1. **Superior Employees**: `/api/employee-superior-document-approvals/user/{userId}/document-type/{documentType}`
2. **User Details**: `/api/users` and `/api/users/{userId}`

### Document Type Mapping
- **Purchase Request**: `PR`

### Transaction Type Mapping
- **NRM**: `NRM` (Purchase Request documents always use this)
- **Entertainment**: `EN`
- **Golf Competition**: `GC`
- **Medical**: `ME`
- **Others**: `OT`
- **Travelling**: `TR`

### Superior Level Mapping
- **Prepared By**: `PR`
- **Checked By**: `CH`
- **Acknowledged By**: `AC`
- **Approved By**: `AP`
- **Received By**: `RE`

## Functionality

### 1. Transaction Type Handling
- Purchase Request documents always use "NRM" as the transaction type
- Superior employee dropdowns are automatically populated when the page loads
- No user selection of transaction type is needed

### 2. Full Name Display
- Superior employees are displayed with their full names instead of usernames
- User data is cached in `window.requesters` to minimize API calls
- Fallback to original superior name if full name is unavailable

### 3. Auto-fill Prepared By
- Current logged-in user is automatically selected for "Prepared By" field
- If current user is not in superiors list, they are added as an option
- Prepared By field is disabled and shows current user's full name

### 4. Search Functionality
- Each approval field has a search input that filters the dropdown options
- Search works with full names, not usernames
- Dropdown shows "Name Not Found" if no matches

### 5. Form Submission
- Special handling for preparedBy field to ensure it's never empty
- Uses current user ID as fallback if preparedBy is empty
- Transaction type is included in form submission

## Error Handling

### 1. API Failures
- Graceful fallback to original superior names if user API calls fail
- Console warnings for debugging
- No blocking errors if superior employee API is unavailable

### 2. Missing Data
- Fallback to current user for preparedBy if no superiors are found
- Empty dropdowns show appropriate placeholder text
- Search shows "Name Not Found" for no results

### 3. Validation
- PreparedBy field is always populated (current user as fallback)
- Transaction type is required for superior employee population
- Form validation ensures all required fields are filled

## Benefits

### 1. User Experience
- Full names are more user-friendly than usernames
- Auto-fill reduces manual input errors
- Search functionality makes it easy to find specific users

### 2. Data Integrity
- Proper filtering ensures only relevant superiors are shown
- Consistent mapping between transaction types and superior levels
- Fallback mechanisms prevent empty required fields

### 3. Performance
- User data caching reduces API calls
- Efficient filtering and search algorithms
- Minimal DOM manipulation

### 4. Maintainability
- Consistent code structure across add and detail pages
- Reusable functions for superior employee handling
- Clear separation of concerns

## Usage

### For Add Purchase Request
1. Superior employee dropdowns are automatically populated with "NRM" transaction type
2. Search for specific users in each approval field
3. Current user is automatically selected for "Prepared By"
4. Submit the form with all required fields

### For Detail Purchase Request
1. Superior employee dropdowns are automatically populated with "NRM" transaction type
2. Search and select appropriate users for each approval field
3. Update or submit the form with changes

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Additional Document Types
- Extend functionality to other document types (Cash Advance, Settlement, etc.)
- Implement consistent superior employee handling across all document types

### 2. Enhanced Search
- Add department-based filtering
- Implement fuzzy search for better matching
- Add user avatars or additional user details

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Implement more sophisticated caching strategies
- Add pagination for large user lists
- Optimize API calls with batching

### 4. User Interface
- Add loading indicators during API calls
- Implement better error messaging
- Add tooltips for field descriptions

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Superior employee dropdowns are automatically populated with "NRM" transaction type
- [ ] Search functionality works with full names
- [ ] Prepared By is auto-filled with current user
- [ ] Form submission includes all required fields
- [ ] Error handling works for API failures
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms work correctly

### Automated Testing

## Conclusion

The Purchase Request superior employee implementation provides a robust, user-friendly solution for managing approval workflows. The implementation follows the same patterns as the Reimbursement functionality, ensuring consistency across the application while providing the specific features needed for Purchase Request documents.
